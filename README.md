The Plugin was tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS using Unreal Editor 5.1.

## Prerequisites

* Install [Unreal Editor](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) and [set up visual studio](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine/)
* For installation on Linux, have a look [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/Linux/BeginnerLinuxDeveloper/SettingUpAnUnrealWorkflow/)
* Have a Unreal Project using Unreal Engine 5.1
* Read the [Editor Interface](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/unreal-editor-interface/) and [Engine Terminology](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/unreal-engine-terminology/) basics

## Installation

* Download the Sensors plugin
* Move it to the *Plugins* folder of your project, create one if it does not exist
* Open your Unreal Project
* Go to Window->Plugins and activate the Sensors plugin which is located under PROJECT/RRLab. For more info check [this](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/working-with-plugins-in-unreal-engine/) link
* Restart the Editor
* If you are asked to rebuild now, press Yes. This will compile the Editor and also the plugin.
* If the editor starts again with no error messages, the Plugin is activated

## Setup

To check the content in Unreal, do the following:
* Open the *Content Browser*
* In the upper right corner of the *Content Browser*, click on *Settings*
* Check *Show Plugin Content*
* On the left of the *Content Browser*, you should now see a folder Plugins containing `Sensors Plugin Content` and `Sensors Plugin C++ Classes`

### Export annotated pointclouds

1. Drag a _RayTracingLiDARActor_  in to your scene, it can be found in `Plugins/Sensors Plugin C++ Classes/LiDAR/`
2. Adapt the parameters (**RayTracingLiDARActorParameters**) of the sensor, they can be found in the *Details* panle
3. Make sure to check **UseRGBOutput** and **WriteObjectID**
4. Under the SensorParent category, change the **TickInterval** variable since it defines the frequency of the sensor (writing to a file is very slow in comparison to creating the pointcloud in the simulation)
5.  In the AdapterComponent of the Sensor copy the path of your file to the **FilePath** variable
6.  To set the ObjectID, follow the following steps:
   1. The ObjectID of an Actor is defined as the first entry of the **Tags** array if that is a number, otherwise it is -1
   2.  Select an actor that should have an ObjectID
   3. Under the Category **Actor** click on the arrow to show the advanced settings
   4. Add an element to the **Tags** array
   5. The first entry is interpreted as a number defining the ObjectID
7. Start the simulation
8. After **TickIntervall** seconds, the pointcloud should written to the file you have selected
9. You can check the Output Log or command line for error messages

### Usage of Particle Lidar
1. Navigate to `PluginsSensors Plugin Content"/LiDAR/ParticleLidar` and drag _BP\_ParticleLidar_ into the scene
2. Parameters such as the channel count can be directly adjusted in the Details panel. To disable the particle rendering, open _PS\_LidarParticleSystem_, and disable **Sprite Renderer**
3. The point cloud can either be used in the C++ class _ParticleLidar.cpp_ or in the Blueprint _BP_ParticleLidar.cpp_. Itâ€™s also possible to use the prebuild Adapters.

See a real-time demo of the sensor here:

### Move sensor along spline
For recording sensor data on a fixed path, there is a [spline](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/blueprint-spline-components-overview-in-unreal-engine/) utilizing an event-based sensor setup.
1. Drag the _SplineFollow_ class into your scene, it can be found in `Plugins/Sensors Plugin C++ Classes/Utils/`
2. Adjust the spline according to your needs, note the following:
   1. The sensor records at every spline point.
   2. There is no recording at the first and last spline point.
   3. The detection of a spline point is done via collision overlap, so your sensor needs to have a mesh with collision
3. Drag a sensor into your scene
4. In the _SplineFollow_ actor, set the variable _Sensor_ as a reference to your previously spawned sensor.
5. Adjust the _Timestep_ according to your application if needed. Every EventTick, the value _Timestep_ is added to the current time on the spline.
6. Start the simulation.
7. Check the _start_ variable of the _SplineFollow_ actor, the sensor should now move along the spline
